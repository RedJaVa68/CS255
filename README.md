DriverPass wants to take advantage of a void in the market in training students for the driving test at the local department of motor vehicles. They noticed that there is a need for better driving training because many people fail their driving tests at the DMV. The system would handle the reservations and scheduling of lessons for students.

The system design gives a good depiction of how the system would function. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would improve the system background of the business requirements to make it more readable. I would use a bullet point list instead of a paragraph to describe the background of the system.

I interpreted the userâ€™s needs by using real world applications and examples of similar systems. I then came up with a list of non functional requirements. 

I approached designing software by going over the functional and non functional requirements of the system. I then determined the the events and outcomes of each part of the system. Next time, I would analyze the design with testing against the system requirements.
